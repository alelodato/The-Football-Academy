The Football Academy website page is made for
a youth football academy for kids from the age 
of 7 to the age of 13.
Users on this website will find useful informations
about the club and why is one of the best youth
football academy in London, all supported by a 
video, a page with the differents teams and the
respective training times and a signup form that
gives the opportunity to book a free training 
session to anyone interested on joining.
The website is targeted towards parents looking
for a football club to join for their kids.

DESIGN

-COLOUR SCHEME:

    As the website is made for a football academy,i wanted to keep green and white as the main colours of it,recalling the coulours of a football pitch.
    Where possible then, i used a white text on a green background, and where more contrast was needed i used a cover text as background for my content.
    All the cover texts are transparent so that the background images are still visible.

    -For all the text context and icons,i have used the colour #fafafa;
    
    -For the Hero Image cover text i have used the colour rgba (193, 24, 21, 0.7);

    -For the Reason section cover text i have used the colour rgba (52, 139, 12, 0.616);

    -The Free Training Session Link colour when hovered is #ad0d0d;

    -For the training and trial pages cover texts i have used the colour rgba (193, 24, 21, 0.9),which is the same as the Hero image cover text,but with less transparency to improve the contrast;

    -For the form submit button of the trial page,i have used the colour #352f2f for the background and #fafafa for the text inside of it.
    The text and background colours swap when the button is hovered;

    -For the Formdump page cover text i have used the color rgba(30, 25, 25, 0.7);

    -The Homepage Link colour when hovered is #086024;

-TYPOGRAPHY

    All the fonts are imported from Google Fonts.
    The Fonts imported are "Bebas Neue" and "Urbanist".

    -The font "Bebas Neue" is a font that i think looks great for headlines,therefore i used it for the logo of the academy and all the page and section titles,sans-serif,in uppercase and with letter-spacing;

    -The font "Urbanist" is the font i used for the pages paragraphs,which are in unppercase,as tried to keep the content as minimal as possible,but due the importance of the informations they contain,i wanted to give them a better visual impact;  
    The navbar menu instead is in lowercase, as it shaped nice and has lovely clean lines.

-IMAGERY AND VIDEOS

    As the website is for a football academy i wanted to use images of kids playing football,so to show the user that playing football is a fun and healthy activity to do for their kids,and eventually if a kid sees the website, i wanted them to imagine about being on pitch and playing, encouraging them to join the academy.
    As mentioned on the colour scheme section,i have also used background images of a football pitch itself for the header,for the navbar menu,for the reasons section and for the footer.
    For this purpose, i have used 5 different background images and video, all from the Pexels website.

-WIREFRAMES
 
    Wireframes were created for mobile,tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

FEATURES

-NAVIGATION:

     The website features a navigation menu,with direct link to the other pages of the website.

    All the navbar elements are shown in white color (hex:#fafafa) and the menu elements font is:"Urbanist";

    A background image from the Pexels website was used for the header and the toggle navigation menu:

     I have confirm that the form works,requires entries in every field,will only accept an email in the email field,and the submit button works.

BUGS

    -Had to fix the formdump link to the form submit button as i was using an absolute path,and it 
     wasn't working on my deployed page;
     This is how the code looked before i fixed it:

      <form id="signup-form" action="/formdump.html">

      After i removed the / from formdump.html,the link worked correctly;

    -Had to add a code to  embed the iframe map as it wasn't working on the deployed page;
     This is how i got the code:
